To make sure our Discord community will always be as welcoming and accepting as it's been so far, here are some rules:

1. **Be nice.** Treat others with kindness and respect. Racism, sexism, bigotry, excessive swearing, doxxing, posting personal information of other members and inciting negative reactions/intentional baiting will not be tolerated.

2. **No piracy.** No form of copyright infringement/piracy is allowed. Do not ask for or post illegally hosted content, irregular streaming websites, and torrents.

3. **Mark spoilers.** Use the in-built spoiler tag when discussing TV shows, movies or any other form of media. Spoiler tags are not required when discussing a DCTV show in its respective channel, however, future content and leaks shall be marked as a spoiler.  

**Syntax:** `||This is a spoiler||` will turn into ||This is a spoiler||.

4. **No advertising.** Posting links to other social media, servers, communities, and services in chat or direct messages will result in an immediate ban.

5. **No NSFW content.** This includes pornographic links, text, images or videos, violent or disgusting content and gore (blood, animal or human remains, etc.). This does not include cursing as long as it is civil.

6. **Respect the server.** Use the <@&435132001193033738> tag to contact the moderators during emergency. Send a message to <@672422978671214592> to report rule violations. Spamming or abusing role tags can result in a ban.  

7. **Respect the server.** Send <@>

8. **Follow Discordâ€™s [community guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines).** You must be at least 13 years old to use Discord, and abide by all other terms and guidelines.
